    <p>I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.</p>
