#### Class Videos

#### Tutoring One-to-One sessions
Tutoring Sessions will be made available to you if needed.

These sessions require that you have turned in homework and are in good standing with your attendance.

**How the system works:**

1) If you are interested in tutoring, you must meet David first during office hours. David will refer student to Shani if additional support is required. You must also meet the attendance and homework requirements (No more than 4 missed classes and no more than 2 missed homework assignments)

**Keep in mind any time zone differences. Please make sure to discuss it with your tutor.  This issue has created a few missed sessions in the past.**

**Sessions should be 45 minutes in length. Once a week via a video using Google Hangouts.**

4) At the end of each session, discuss scheduling the next session with your tutor directly.

5) Both the tutor and the student are **required** to fill out an evaluation form after EACH session.  Data is very important to the ongoing success of Central Support.  **Every tutor assignment email has the link to the Studentâ€™s Evaluation Form.**

* **If a student No-Shows to a session, the student may not be eligible for tutoring in the future.**

* **If student needs to change the appointment communicate with your tutor immediately.**
